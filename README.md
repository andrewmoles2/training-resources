Look at the datasets on [height](https://clio-infra.eu/Indicators/Height.html) as an example; the academic data can be found [here](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/wirtschafts-und-sozialwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/faecher/fachbereich-wirtschaftswissenschaft/wirtschaftswissenschaft/lehrstuehle/volkswirtschaftslehre/wirtschaftsgeschichte/forschung/data-hub-height/).

*  [European Social Survey (ESS)](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/) which has data on how people perceive politics and happiness in their countries. 

## Helpful training tools

* Guess the correlation game - https://www.guessthecorrelation.com/ - a fun way to learn what different R-squared values look like visualised. I like to make it a class-wide discussion game.
* What is going on in this graph - https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph - a useful resource to help create discussions about data visualisation such as if a graph is still readable/interpretable with some labels or titles missing

## Open-source tools

*  [RAWGraphs](https://www.rawgraphs.io/) is a good open-source data visualisation tool/BI tool like Tableau or PowerBi.
*  [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) is a great open-source markdown editor which allows for collaboration. It has a wide array of really nice features like graphviz and callouts too.
*  [Insomnia](https://github.com/Kong/insomnia) is an open-source API client that I have found helpful when using APIs for web scraping.
*  [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built around markdown and the R and Python ecosystems. It is my go-to tool for reporting and building websites.
*  [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/libreoffice/) is an open-source version of MS Office including equivalents for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access.

## Courses

*  Data science in a box - https://datasciencebox.org/ & https://github.com/tidyverse/datascience-box - covers pedagogy on teaching fundamentals of data science (using R)
*  [Data Garden](https://data-garden.notion.site/Data-Garden-Guidebook-47a11bf555ab40bfbf68540d85067e9f) which is learning to code through creative data visualisation using JavaScript (p5.js). You can see what people have made on their [project page](https://datagardenproject.com/). 

## Ideas and inspiration 

*  Information is beautiful awards - https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase?award=2023&mc_cid=9d8f228bb5&type=awards - many amazing visualisations made over the years. Some even share their code if they have used R/Python/JavaScript
