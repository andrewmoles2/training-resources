## Helpful training tools

* Guess the correlation game - https://www.guessthecorrelation.com/ - a fun way to learn what different R-squared values look like visualised. I like to make it a class-wide discussion game.
* What is going on in this graph - https://www.nytimes.com/column/whats-going-on-in-this-graph - a useful resource to help create discussions about data visualisation such as if a graph is still readable/interpretable with some labels or titles missing

## Courses

*  Data science in a box - https://datasciencebox.org/ & https://github.com/tidyverse/datascience-box - covers pedagogy on teaching fundamentals of data science (using R)

## Ideas and inspiration 

*  Information is beautiful awards - https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase?award=2023&mc_cid=9d8f228bb5&type=awards - many amazing visualisations made over the years. Some even share their code if they have used R/Python/JavaScript
